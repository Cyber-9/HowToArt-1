            <p>Bright colors. Pop culture. And again - a lot of bright colors. Congratulations, you've pretty much got all you need to know about pop art under your belt. Okay, maybe there's a bit more to it than that. But if you're going to take anything away from this lesson, at least let it be that: bright colors and culture. First things first, the pop art movement was more of a rebellion. Up until the mid to late 1950s, in both the U.K. and U.S., fineart was dominating the art world. People were pretty fond of those 1800s oil paintings of monarchs. They were the norm. One of the most beautiful things about pop art is that it was pretty much a big 'screw you' to that stereotype entirely. This was a colorful, loud, and different movement.Pop art was breaking down that hierarchy in the art community. It made itself into a groundbreaking style that people loved. And it wasn't just the bright color scheme that drew people in. The artists who made pop art focused on an entirely new subject matter. Celebrities, social issues, and basically anything in modern media - was what went into pop art. Some pop artists took the mudane things of everyday life and made them colorful, eye-catching, and exciting. There are no real rules or boundaries to pop art.You do what you do! A lot of pop artists took inspiration from old school comics; some of the most famous pop art is simply of words and phrases. But enough talking, let's just get into the examples:</p>
